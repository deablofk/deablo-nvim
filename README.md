## Description
Welcome to my customized Neovim configuration tailored for efficient Java and Scala development. While optimized for these languages, this configuration is versatile and can be easily adapted for other programming languages according to your preferences.

## Note
Currently, it works only on Linux (probably, I haven't tested on Windows or Mac).

## Installation
Follow these simple steps to set up the enhanced Neovim configuration:

1. Clone this repository into your Neovim configuration folder:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/neovim-config.git ~/.config/nvim/
   ```
2. Start Neovim; this will install the plugins...
   ```bash
   nvim
   ```
3. Wait until the Packer floating window title becomes "finish."
4. Close Neovim and restart it. You are ready!

## TODO

- DAP
- NvimTree LSP File Operations
- Implement ultimate auto-pair on default mode (delete key)
